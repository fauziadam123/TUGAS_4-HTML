    <h2>Dovizioso: the attendance king</h2>
    <p>he Italian, along with teammate Jorge Lorenzo, has been competing on the World stage for 16 straight years – the third highest on the grid behind Valentino Rossi (Movistar Yamaha MotoGP) and Dani Pedrosa (Repsol Honda Team). It’s a huge testament to the 32-year-old, who in the last two years has been – on paper - Marc Marquez’ (Repsol Honda Team) most consistent challenger.

But how does ‘DesmoDovi’ compare to the other riders who have the most consecutive Grand Prix starts? Well, next up is ‘The Doctor’ on 230, with fellow Italian Max Biaggi the only other rider to reach the 200 milestone – 201 successive starts for ‘The Roman Emperor’. Completing the top five is Frenchman Randy de Puniet and 2012 Moto3™ World Champion Sando Cortese – both of whom sit on 190. </p>
